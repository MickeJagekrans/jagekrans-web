=============

My public website. About time, too.


Plans
=====

My initial plan for this is to build a personal website acting as my online CV. 
On top of this I will also build a couple of smaller applications for demonstration purposes.

Some project ideas:
- A small e-commerce system
- A booking application

The systems will be built with different technologies and programming languages. Some interoperability will be implemented as well.

Techs/languages:
- node.js/express.js
- Javascript
- AngularJS
- KnockoutJS
- Rails
- .NET
- Coffeescript
- socket.io
